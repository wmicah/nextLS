# üîê Logout & Re-authentication Fix

## Problem

When users clicked "Logout" and then "Sign In" again, Kinde was automatically logging them back into the same account without asking for credentials. This prevented users from being able to switch roles after deletion.

## Root Cause

Kinde uses session persistence and "Remember Me" functionality by default. When a user logs out, Kinde clears the application session but may keep the authentication session active at the Kinde level, allowing automatic re-login.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Force Re-authentication on Login** ‚úÖ

Added `authUrlParams={{ prompt: "login" }}` to all `LoginLink` components:

**Files Updated:**

- `src/components/Navbar.tsx` - Main navigation "Sign In" button
- `src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` - Sign in page button

**What this does:**

- Forces Kinde to show the login screen every time
- Prevents automatic re-authentication from cached sessions
- Users must enter credentials even if they just logged out

### 2. **Proper Logout Implementation** ‚úÖ

Updated `ClientWaitingPage.tsx` to use direct logout URL:

```typescript
const handleLogout = () => {
  window.location.href = "/api/auth/logout?post_logout_redirect_url=/";
};
```

**What this does:**

- Clears the Kinde session completely
- Redirects to home page after logout
- Ensures clean logout state

## Expected Behavior Now

### Scenario 1: User Logs Out

1. User clicks "Logout" button
2. Kinde session is cleared
3. User is redirected to home page
4. ‚úÖ User is completely logged out

### Scenario 2: User Signs In Again

1. User clicks "Sign In" button
2. Kinde shows login screen (even if they just logged out)
3. User must enter credentials
4. ‚úÖ User can log in with any account (including a different one)

### Scenario 3: User Deletes Account

1. User deletes account from client waiting page
2. Account deleted from database
3. User logged out from Kinde
4. Redirected to home with success message
5. When user clicks "Sign In" again:
   - Must enter credentials (no auto-login)
   - Goes through role selection
   - ‚úÖ Can select a different role

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Logout from client waiting page ‚Üí redirects to home
- [ ] Click "Sign In" ‚Üí shows Kinde login screen (not auto-login)
- [ ] Delete account ‚Üí logs out and redirects
- [ ] Sign in after deletion ‚Üí goes to role selection
- [ ] Can select different role after re-registration

## Technical Details

### `prompt: "login"` Parameter

This is an OAuth 2.0 standard parameter that:

- Forces the authorization server to show the login screen
- Ignores any existing authentication sessions
- Requires fresh user authentication

### Kinde Logout Flow

1. `/api/auth/logout` - Kinde's logout endpoint
2. Clears server-side session
3. Clears client-side cookies
4. Redirects to `post_logout_redirect_url`

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### ‚ùå Using `max_age=0`

- Forces re-authentication but less explicit
- Not as widely supported

### ‚ùå Clearing cookies manually

- Fragile and error-prone
- Doesn't work with httpOnly cookies
- Kinde manages its own cookie strategy

### ‚úÖ Using `prompt: "login"` (Chosen)

- Standard OAuth 2.0 parameter
- Explicitly supported by Kinde
- Most reliable cross-browser solution
- Clear intent and behavior

## Notes

- The `prompt: "login"` parameter only affects the login flow, not normal navigation
- Users who are already logged in and navigating the app won't be affected
- This only forces re-authentication when explicitly clicking "Sign In"
- Kinde's session management is still secure and follows best practices

## Future Enhancements

If you still experience auto-login issues:

1. **Check Kinde Dashboard Settings:**

   - Go to Kinde Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Authentication
   - Disable "Remember Me" if enabled
   - Set session timeout to a shorter duration

2. **Add `prompt: "select_account"`:**

   - Shows account picker even if only one account
   - Allows users to explicitly choose which account to use

3. **Implement Complete Kinde Deletion:**
   - Follow `ACCOUNT_DELETION_SETUP.md` to set up Management API
   - Completely removes users from Kinde (not just database)
   - Prevents any possibility of auto-login after deletion
