# 🔧 Video Upload Debug Solution

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

Videos are uploading successfully to UploadThing but disappearing after page refresh on Vercel deployment. This works fine locally but fails in production.

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue is likely caused by one or more of these Vercel-specific problems:

### **1. Database Connection Issues** ⚠️

- **Most Likely**: Database transactions are failing silently on Vercel
- **Evidence**: Videos appear briefly (UploadThing upload succeeds) but disappear after refresh (database query fails)
- **Cause**: Connection timeouts, transaction rollbacks, or database connection pool issues

### **2. Environment Variable Issues** ⚠️

- **Possible**: Missing or incorrect environment variables on Vercel
- **Evidence**: Error we saw about missing environment variables
- **Cause**: Environment variables not properly set in Vercel dashboard

### **3. Database Transaction Issues** ⚠️

- **Possible**: Database transactions being rolled back due to errors
- **Cause**: Connection timeouts, constraint violations, or transaction isolation issues

## 🛠️ **Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Error Logging** ✅

- Added comprehensive logging to both `upload` and `importYouTubeVideo` mutations
- Added transaction wrapping for data consistency
- Added detailed error tracking with timestamps and context

### **2. Database Transaction Safety** ✅

- Wrapped database operations in `db.$transaction()` for atomicity
- Added proper error handling and rollback protection
- Enhanced logging for each step of the process

### **3. Diagnostic Endpoint** ✅

- Created `/api/debug-upload` endpoint to test:
  - Database connectivity
  - Environment variables
  - Recent uploads
  - Vercel-specific information

## 🚀 **Next Steps to Fix the Issue**

### **Step 1: Deploy and Test Diagnostic Endpoint**

```bash
# Deploy your changes to Vercel
git add .
git commit -m "Add enhanced error logging and diagnostic tools for video upload debugging"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Test the Diagnostic Endpoint**

Visit: `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/debug-upload`

This will show you:

- ✅ Database connection status
- ✅ Environment variables status
- ✅ Recent uploads
- ✅ Vercel-specific information

### **Step 3: Check Vercel Environment Variables**

In your Vercel dashboard, verify these environment variables are set:

**Required Variables:**

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=your_uploadthing_secret
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=your_uploadthing_app_id
KINDE_CLIENT_ID=your_kinde_client_id
KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_kinde_client_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app
```

### **Step 4: Test Upload with Enhanced Logging**

1. Try uploading a video on Vercel
2. Check the Vercel function logs in the dashboard
3. Look for the detailed logging we added:
   - 🚀 Starting upload mutation
   - ✅ User authenticated
   - ✅ Coach verification passed
   - 📝 Creating database record
   - ✅ Database record created successfully
   - 🎉 Upload completed successfully

### **Step 5: Check Database Connection**

If the diagnostic endpoint shows database connection issues:

1. **Verify DATABASE_URL** is correct in Vercel
2. **Check database accessibility** from Vercel's IP ranges
3. **Ensure SSL is enabled** for database connections
4. **Check connection limits** on your database provider

## 🔧 **Common Vercel-Specific Fixes**

### **Database Connection Issues**

```bash
# If using Vercel Postgres, ensure connection string includes SSL
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=require"

# If using external database, ensure it allows Vercel IPs
# Add Vercel's IP ranges to your database allowlist
```

### **Environment Variable Issues**

```bash
# Ensure all required variables are set in Vercel dashboard
# Check for typos in variable names
# Verify URLs use HTTPS for production
```

### **Transaction Timeout Issues**

```bash
# If transactions are timing out, consider:
# 1. Reducing transaction complexity
# 2. Increasing database connection timeout
# 3. Using connection pooling
```

## 📊 **Monitoring and Debugging**

### **Check Vercel Function Logs**

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Functions
2. Look for recent function executions
3. Check for error logs and our enhanced logging

### **Database Query Logs**

If you have database query logging enabled, check for:

- Failed INSERT statements
- Connection timeouts
- Transaction rollbacks

### **UploadThing Logs**

Check UploadThing dashboard for:

- Successful file uploads
- Any errors during upload process

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Fix**

After implementing these solutions, you should see:

1. **Detailed logging** in Vercel function logs
2. **Successful database transactions** with proper error handling
3. **Videos persisting** after page refresh
4. **Clear error messages** if something still fails

## 🆘 **If Issues Persist**

If videos still disappear after implementing these fixes:

1. **Check the diagnostic endpoint** for specific error details
2. **Review Vercel function logs** for our enhanced error messages
3. **Verify database permissions** and connection limits
4. **Test with a simple database query** to isolate the issue
5. **Consider database provider limitations** (connection limits, timeout settings)

## 📝 **Files Modified**

- ✅ `src/trpc/index.ts` - Enhanced upload and YouTube import mutations
- ✅ `src/app/api/debug-upload/route.ts` - New diagnostic endpoint
- ✅ `VIDEO_UPLOAD_DEBUG_SOLUTION.md` - This solution document

## 🔄 **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Deploy changes to Vercel
- [ ] Test diagnostic endpoint
- [ ] Verify environment variables
- [ ] Test video upload with logging
- [ ] Check Vercel function logs
- [ ] Verify videos persist after refresh
- [ ] Test YouTube import functionality
