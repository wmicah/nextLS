# Database Connection Issues - Fix Summary

## Problem

Your application was experiencing random database connection failures that caused everything to stop working. The issues were caused by:

1. **No connection pooling configuration** - Prisma was using default settings
2. **No connection timeouts** - Connections could hang indefinitely
3. **No connection limits** - Too many concurrent connections
4. **Improper connection handling** - Connections not being properly closed

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Database Configuration (`src/db/index.ts`)

**What Changed:**

- Added connection pool settings via connection string parameters
- Implemented graceful shutdown handling
- Added proper error handling for uncaught exceptions
- Removed problematic `$connect()` call

**Key Features:**

```typescript
// Connection pool settings
connection_limit = 10; // Max connections in pool
pool_timeout = 20; // Timeout when acquiring connection
connect_timeout = 10; // Timeout when establishing connection
```

**Benefits:**

- Prevents connection pool exhaustion
- Handles connection timeouts gracefully
- Properly closes connections on shutdown
- Better error recovery

### 2. Database Health Check Script (`scripts/db-health-check.ts`)

**What It Does:**

- Checks database connectivity
- Monitors connection pool status
- Identifies long-running queries
- Tracks active and idle connections
- Validates connection string configuration

**How to Use:**

```bash
npm run db:health
```

**What It Checks:**

- ✅ Database connection status
- ✅ Connection pool health
- ✅ Query performance
- ✅ Database size
- ✅ Active connections
- ✅ Idle connections
- ✅ Long-running queries
- ✅ Connection string configuration

### 3. Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide (`DATABASE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`)

**Contents:**

- Common database issues and solutions
- Manual SQL queries for diagnostics
- Environment variable configuration
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Best practices for connection management
- Troubleshooting steps for common problems
- Supabase-specific guidance

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Step 1: Restart Your Application

```bash
# Stop the application
pm2 stop your-app

# Start the application
pm2 start your-app

# Or if using npm
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Run Health Check

```bash
npm run db:health
```

This will verify that:

- Database is accessible
- Connection pool is configured correctly
- No issues with active connections

### Step 3: Monitor for Issues

Keep an eye on your application logs for the next few hours:

```bash
# If using PM2
pm2 logs your-app

# Or check application logs
tail -f logs/app.log
```

### Step 4: Set Up Regular Health Checks

Add to your crontab or monitoring system:

```bash
# Run health check every hour
0 * * * * cd /path/to/your/app && npm run db:health
```

## Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file has the correct configuration:

```env
# Main database connection (with pool settings)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database?connection_limit=10&pool_timeout=20&connect_timeout=10"

# Direct connection (for migrations)
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database"
```

**Note:** The connection pool settings are now automatically added by the application, but you can also add them directly to your `DATABASE_URL` for more control.

## What to Watch For

### Warning Signs:

- Health check shows warnings
- Application logs show connection errors
- Response times increase
- Users report timeouts

### If Issues Persist:

1. **Run the health check:**

   ```bash
   npm run db:health
   ```

2. **Check your database provider:**

   - Verify connection limits
   - Check for service issues
   - Review connection usage

3. **Review the troubleshooting guide:**

   ```bash
   cat DATABASE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
   ```

4. **Check application logs:**
   ```bash
   pm2 logs your-app --lines 100
   ```

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes, you should see:

✅ **No more random crashes** - Connection pool prevents exhaustion  
✅ **Faster response times** - Proper connection management  
✅ **Better error handling** - Graceful degradation on failures  
✅ **Easier debugging** - Health check script provides diagnostics  
✅ **More stability** - Proper shutdown and error recovery

## Monitoring Recommendations

### 1. Set Up Alerts

Configure alerts for:

- Active connections > 50
- Idle connections > 20
- Query response time > 500ms
- Connection errors > 10 per minute

### 2. Regular Health Checks

Run health checks:

- Daily: Full health check
- Hourly: Quick connection test
- On errors: Immediate diagnostics

### 3. Log Monitoring

Watch for:

- Connection timeout errors
- "Too many connections" errors
- Slow query warnings
- Connection pool exhaustion

## Additional Improvements

### If You're Using Supabase:

1. **Check your tier limits:**

   - Free: 60 concurrent connections
   - Pro: 200 concurrent connections
   - Team: 400 concurrent connections

2. **Use connection pooler:**

   - Use `pooler.supabase.com` for your connection URL
   - Keeps connection count low
   - Better for serverless environments

3. **Monitor in Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Check connection usage
   - Review query performance
   - Monitor for slow queries

### If You're Using Vercel:

1. **Use serverless connection pooling:**

   - Vercel Postgres has built-in pooling
   - Use `@vercel/postgres` for better performance
   - Or use PgBouncer-compatible pooler

2. **Optimize for serverless:**
   - Keep connections short-lived
   - Use connection pooling
   - Avoid long-running queries

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: Basic Connectivity

```bash
npm run db:health
```

Expected: All checks pass ✅

### Test 2: Load Test

```bash
# Simulate multiple concurrent requests
for i in {1..20}; do
  curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/test &
done
wait
```

Expected: No connection errors

### Test 3: Long-Running Test

```bash
# Run for 30 minutes and monitor
npm run db:health
# Wait 30 minutes
npm run db:health
```

Expected: No connection pool exhaustion

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback:

1. **Restore original database config:**

   ```bash
   git checkout src/db/index.ts
   ```

2. **Restart application:**

   ```bash
   pm2 restart your-app
   ```

3. **Monitor for issues:**
   ```bash
   pm2 logs your-app
   ```
